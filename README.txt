This is a repository for work by Rob Lasell in Comp 116
(Computer Security) at Tufts University, Fall 2014.
The class was taught by Ming Chow. 

My favorite assignment in the course was probably the forensics
assignment. I enjoyed using techniques that we had learned in
class to accomplish something that really felt as though it had a real-world application. Most of the other assignments felt the same way to
varying degrees, but for some reason the forensics assignment stood out.

As far as my academic growth is concerned, I think that I have changed a lot since the first lecture of 116. I have gained a bunch of new skills and knowledge. However, security is an extensive field, and nobody can become an expert over the course of a single semester-long course. I would say that the most important thing that I have received from the class is a deeper understanding both of the different factors that make up security as a field and of the critical importance of security as a consideration in any aspect of computer science.

In other words, I learned how important it is to consider security as a developer, even if I don't end up being a security master by trade. As an example, while researching the Home Depot and Target breaches, I was surprised to learn that, although the breaches targeted the retailers' POS systems, it was probably necessary for the attackers to gain access to the companies' internal networks beforehand, and that they probably did so by exploiting web server vulnerabilities on the targets' front ends. My heart goes out to whatever hapless web developers now bear partial responsibility for 100 million+ credit cards being compromised!

Another example would be the realization partway through the semester that my passwords are terrible and should be changed more frequently.

Now that the semester is over, I think that I would like to learn more about crypto. The course didn't spend too much time on it, and I happened to be reading a few books about codebreaking in WWII on my own at the same time as the crypto unit in class, so my interest was piqued.
